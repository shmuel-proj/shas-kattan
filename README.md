There is an old tradition commonly referenced in the yeshiva community that Masekhet Ketubot is the "Shas Kattan" of Talmud Bavli, that is, it contains ideas that connect to just about every other area of Shas (short for "Shisha Sidrei," all six orders of the Mishnah). Personally, I have thought that this doesn't really seem to be the case; there seem to me to be much better candidates for Shas Kattan, such as Pesachim or Nedarim, when one considers all six orders of the Mishnah. What this project seeks to answer is the question: would there be a way to computationally determine which tractate has the most varied connections to other tractates in Shas?
